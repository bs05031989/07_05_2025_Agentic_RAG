🔧 Agentic RAG + Private LLMs: A Blueprint for Secure, Autonomous AI Systems 🧠🔐

In the evolution from prompt engineering to full-stack LLMOps, LLMs are moving from passive responders to autonomous agents that reason, plan, and execute across complex data and tasks.
Agentic RAG—an architecture where an LLM doesn't just retrieve and summarize, but acts iteratively on retrieved knowledge, maintains context across steps, and executes tools dynamically.

But the technical question we face in real-world deployments is:

👉 How do we enable agentic behavior on proprietary data, with privacy, latency, and control in mind?

Here’s what our current open-source Agentic RAG stack looks like:

🧱 Private LLM Backbone
Running LLama 3 (Meta) or Mistral via vLLM or TGI for high-throughput, low-latency inference behind the firewall.
Quantized with GGUF + llama.cpp for edge deployments or air-gapped infra.

📚 Retrieval Layer

Weaviate or Qdrant for vector search, paired with Haystack or LlamaIndex for hybrid search and metadata filtering.
Using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) or LangGraph to compose modular RAG pipelines.

🧠 Agentic Control

LangGraph or CrewAI to model dynamic workflows where agents (backed by private LLMs) can make decisions, call tools, and collaborate asynchronously.
Integrated with Toolformer-style API planning and function calling via JSON schema for robust tool use.

🔐 Security, Privacy, and Observability

All deployments containerized, running on Kubernetes with Istio for service mesh + telemetry.
Model observability via Traceloop / WhyLabs, policy enforcement via OPA (Open Policy Agent).

💡 The result? A composable system where agents reason over your domain-specific knowledge base, call tools, and automate decisions—all while running privately, on your infrastructure.
Agentic RAG + Private LLMs isn’t just an architecture. It’s a philosophy: data sovereignty, modular reasoning, and secure automation.
If you're building internal AI copilots or task agents in regulated or IP-sensitive environments—this is the path forward.
Would love to hear what stacks others are using in this space.
